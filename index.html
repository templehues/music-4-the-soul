        R&B and soul are two genres that I believe are the perfect way to uplift
        and show one's emotions. R&B, also known as Rhythm & Blues, has roots in
        musical genres like
        <span class="music-genre"
          >jazz, blues, gospel, boogie-woogie, and jump blues</span
        >. R&B originated in the 1940s, dominated the charts, took over in the
        1960s, and took the world by storm. Soul roots come from gospel music,
        and R&B originated in the late 1950s but only started dominating
        international charts in the 1960s. Hip-hop is both a musical genre and a
        culture among black people. Hip-hop originated in the 1970s by African
        Americans in Brox, New York; it was only in the 1980s that it was
        diversified, developed into more complex styles, and spread around the
        world.
        <br />
        <br />These 3 genres have a greater impact on the black community and
        have helped black people voice out their struggles and emotions and help
        cope with them. Hip-hop is more education when it comes to learning
        about the political problems POC face in different parts of the world,
        but it also helps artists express problems and emotions they cannot talk
        about. Music is by far the best way to express your thoughts and every
        emotion you can think of, from extremely happy to depressed if you need
        a way to express yourself. Listen to music, or make music! üòÑ
